# Custom Scripts
* They were used in a MEG study focusing on the effects of spatial frequency (SF) and color on M170. 

# Processing Workflow
* Digital image processing
1. Adjustment of mean luminance of BSF images: "MakeColorBSFpics.m"
2. Creating spatially-filtered chromatic images: "ImageFiltering_butterworth.m"
3. Creating equiluminant chromatic images: "MakeEquiluminantPics.m"
